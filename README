*slaMEM* is a tool used to efficiently retrieve _MEMs_ (`Maximal Exact Matches`)
between a reference sequence and one or more query sequences, similarly to
these software tools:
* [MUMmer](http://mummer.sourceforge.net/)
* [essaMEM] (https://github.ugent.be/ComputationalBiology/essaMEM)
* [sparseMEM] (http://compbio.cs.princeton.edu/mems/)
* [backwardMEM](http://www.uni-ulm.de/in/theo/research/seqana.html#c102393)

*slaMEM* relies on an [FM-Index][1] coupled with a new data structure called
*SSILCP* (`Sampled Search Intervals and Longest Common Prefixes`) to store
information about _parent intervals_ in a space and time efficient way.

*slaMEM* also includes an useful feature to display the locations of the found
MEMs, generating images like the one below.

###### Install
Just compile it with `make`.

###### Usage
Just run `./slaMEM` with no arguments for a list of options.
